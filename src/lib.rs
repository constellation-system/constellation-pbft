//! Implementation of the Castro-Liskov PBFT consensus protocol.
//!
//! This crate provides an implementation of the Castro-Liskov PBFT
//! consensus protocol usable in the Constellation distributed systems
//! platfrom.  The Castro-Liskov protocol is described by the paper
//! [Practical Byzantine Fault
//! Tolerance](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/296806.296824).  It
//! provide a consensus protocol resilient against a Byzantine
//! Adversary who controls up to but not including 1/3rd of the
//! parties in the consensus pool.
